#  Target Prediction System

This project simulates and predicts the path of airborne targets such as drones or missiles using basic physics principles. It helps in early tracking and interception â€” making it useful for defense and surveillance applications.

---

##  Features

- Predicts total distance traveled by the target
- Calculates flight time based on input parameters
- Command-line based input/output
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into larger systems

---

##  How It Works

Given:
- **Initial speed** of the target (in m/s)
- **Launch angle** (in degrees)

It uses projectile motion formulas to compute:
- Total distance traveled
- Time of flight
- Maximum height of the target
